## RunRocket

Runrocket is a game where you navigate into spaces caves, tunnels and weird huge corridors.
Basic concept about flying a rocket between points A to B came from one of the projects I did during Unity course from GamDevTV.

After finishing courses I decided to change core gameplay to a few not quite easy levels. Players will be able to move on after ending the current level and go back to it later.

I would like a player to be careful all the time about gravity other than Earth and at the same time feel the pressure of passing time.

## Core Mechanics

Time lapse - Complete the level before time runs out.

Battery - some levels are darker, try to grabbing battery for better vision

Obstacles - don't touch the obstacles (some of them may move).

Level selector - after completing a level, you can return to it, but you can't go further without completing the current level.
